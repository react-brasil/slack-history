But if you&#39;re doing this professionally, I do recommend you to at least look into the proper computer science stuff, e.g. classic data structures &amp; runtime analysis. Again, think of the spectrum of abstractions: do you need math/CS right now to ship your web app? Likely not. Do you need it to jump into a related software domain you couldn&#39;t have otherwise? Probably.</p>\n<p>There are definitely some more CS/Math-y domains such as crypto, machine learning, and anything low-level. I&#39;d say don&#39;t be uncomfortable not knowing the theory, but make sure you do learn some so that you don&#39;t get stuck writing the same webapp in ten years.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s my recommendation to get started (I know this works because that&#39;s how I got started): read about some simple but non-trivial data structures like binary tree, and implement one yourself. Then do it for hash map, heap, trie. One day when folks are talking about things one abstraction level lower than what you&#39;re programming in, you&#39;ll suddenly start to realize things and connect concepts. It&#39;s an exciting feeling.</p>\n<p>You&#39;re literally &quot;powerful&quot; once you learn proper CS. Folks usually counter that with the argument &quot;yeah but it&#39;s not needed for what I&#39;m doing right now&quot;, which is really talking beside the point if you think about it regarding abstraction spectrum. I think &quot;it&#39;s not needed for what I&#39;m doing&quot; is actually a <em>great</em> stance, as it prevents over-engineering, which is pretty much the root of all evil (the Reason community tries really hard not to reach for overly powerful and un-useful patterns like monads and other type-level tricks). But it has to be a learned, carefully understood stance, not an argument to defend your temporary ignorance. (edited)</p>\n",
